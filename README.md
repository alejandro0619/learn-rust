# RustðŸŽ‰

I'll be learning rust mainly throught RBE (Rust By Example), altough, I'm gonna check the rust-book to learn more theorically every concept.

By the way. If I decide to mix my learning path with other resources, I will create a new markdown file where I share with you guys all the books I'm learning from.

Kinda Unnecesary to remark, but I'm a developer with a Javascript/Typescript background so, in some point I'll be comparing features between 'em without digging too deep. 

DO NOT USE THIS REPOSITORY AS A LEARNING RESOURCE. because I may commit errors that will confuse you for sure :)
