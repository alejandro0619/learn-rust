# RustðŸŽ‰

I'll be learning rust mainly throught RBE (Rust By Example), altough, I'm gonna check the rust-book to learn more theorically every concept.

By the way. If I decide to mix my learning path with other sources, I will create a new markdown file where I share with you guys all the books I'm learning from.

Kinda Unnecesary to remark, but I'm a developer with a Javascript/Typescript background so, in some point I'll be comparing features between 'em without digging too deep. if you find a error, feel free to open a new issue :)

Hope this can help you to learn this beatiful language.
