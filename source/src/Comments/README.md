# üìç Comments:

## Wait, comments? What is it?

Well, comments are lines that isn't part of the executable code.
Think of it as a reminder that you leave in your code to explain what it does, so you in the future will understand what a specific piece of your code does. It is incredibly useful, isn't it?

Here is how does comments looks like and how you can use it.
There're two types of comments: **inline comments and block comments** :

As you can see right below, inline comments start with a **double slash** ( // ) and right next you can write until the end of the line. On the other hand we can see how block comments start with a **slash, asteric and ends with an asteric and slash** (/* */). the content of the comments must be between it.

Here is a example of how can you use comments:

```Rust
//This is inline comment, a comment in only one line, short but descriptive.

/*
And here is block comment, as you can see, I can use many lines as I need to. This is very useful when I gotta explain something kind of complex.
*/

```

Watch the [code here](./comments.rs) and identify the two types of comments I'm using.
