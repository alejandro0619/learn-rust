# üìç Primitives:

Rust provides access to a wide variety of primitives. A sample includes:

- Scalar Types
  - signed integers: ```i8, i16, i32, i64, i128 and isize``` (pointer size)
  - unsigned integers: ```u8, u16, u32, u64, u128``` and usize (pointer size)
  - floating point: ```f32, f64```
  - char Unicode scalar values like ```'a', 'Œ±' and '‚àû'``` (4 bytes each)
  - bool either ```true``` or ```false```
- And the unit type ```()```, whose only possible value is an empty      
  - tuple: ```()``` <br>
Despite the value of a unit type being a tuple, it is not considered a compound type because it does not contain multiple values.

- Compound Types
  - arrays like ```[1, 2, 3]```
  - tuples like ```(1, true)```
  - Variables can always be type annotated. Numbers may additionally be annotated via a suffix or by default. Integers default to ```i32``` and floats to ```f64```. Note that Rust can also infer types from context.
