# üìç hello world

## hello world? Let's create our first program in rust!

Our program will print a text in the console, as hello world is a wide used example to show the first steps into a programming language, we'll create a simple but awesome hello world program and I will introduce you to a basic concept named functions.


## But... what's a function?
Lets say a function is a piece of code that will be executed as many times as you want. But we'll dig inside of it later, for now: It's just a piece of code that will be executed as many times as you want, ok?

## Main function:
In every Rust program you will find a entry point, that entry point is where the code start executing. If we want our code to be executed we need to place it inside of the main function in order to make it happen.
