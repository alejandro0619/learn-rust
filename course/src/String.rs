    // We talked about Strins already, but we'll look at them in a more depth now.
    // New Rustaceans commonly get stcuk on strings for a comb. of three reasons
    // Rust's propensity for exposing possible errors
    // strings being a more complicated data structure than many others
    // and UTF-8
    // These factors combine in a way that can seem difficult when
    // you're coming from other programming languages.
    //
    // We discuss strings in the context of collections because strings are
    // implemented as collection of bytes, plus som methods to provide a useful
    // functionality when those bytes are interpreted as texts.
    //
    // In this section, we'll talk the operations on String that every 
    // collection type has, such as creating, updating, and reading.
    // We'll also discuss the ways in which String is different from other
    // collections, namely how to indexing into a string is complicated
    // by the differences between how people and computers interpret 
    // String data.
